I have for years used [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) for keeping to-do lists and some general notes. Recently though I got particularly annoyed by it's poor syncing between devices and collaborators.

For quick to-do lists I have moved to [Keep](https://www.google.com/keep/) which has been working very well for this basic task.

This left choosing a more long term place to store the longer form notes and knowledge I had in OneNote. A self-hosted approach appealed to me for a number of reasons.

Coincidently a recent episode of [selhosted.show](https://selfhosted.show/) took on the topic of [Which Wiki Wins](https://selfhosted.show/12).

They looked at:

* <https://tiddlywiki.com/>
* <https://wiki.js.org/>
* <https://www.bookstackapp.com/>
* <https://www.mkdocs.org/>

I also took a look at <https://www.gitbook.com/>

In the end I chose MkDocs. I like markdown and not having to run a database as it generates static HTML as output.

Getting started is very quick:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs
mkdocs new wiki
cd wiki
mkdocs serve
```

## Porting from OneNote

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor mostly.
To help editing markdown I use some plugins:

* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - Adds linting to ensure I keep my markdown correct.
* [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts) - Mainly useful me to `Ctrl M + B` to create lists and `Ctrl + L` to wrap bare links.
* [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright) - I make a lot of spelling mistakes.

To migrate tables I copied and pasted in to Excel and then in to an [online tool]((https://thisdavej.com/copy-table-in-excel-and-paste-as-a-markdown-table/)
) to convert to markdown.

OneNote likes to end each line with a space which does not agree with the markdown linter. To get around this I used find replace in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to remove occurrences of "` $`".
