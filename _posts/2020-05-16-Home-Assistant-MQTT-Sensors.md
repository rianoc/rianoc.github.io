## Adding MQTT sensors to Home Assistant

Previously I posted about the [Arduino Environmental Monitoring]({{ site.url }}/2020/04/14/Arduino/) system I made. It published it's data to MQTT.
Adding the sensors to Home Assistant was quick. Adding the following to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  platform: mqtt
  name: "Living Room Temperature"
  state_topic: "hassio/livingroom/temperature"
  qos: 0
  unit_of_measurement: "ÂºC"

sensor 2:
  platform: mqtt
  name: "Living Room Humidity"
  state_topic: "hassio/livingroom/humidity"
  qos: 0
  unit_of_measurement: "%"

sensor 3:
  platform: mqtt
  name: "Living Room Pressure"
  state_topic: "hassio/livingroom/pressure"
  qos: 0
  unit_of_measurement: "hPa"

sensor 4:
  platform: mqtt
  name: "Living Room Light"
  state_topic: "hassio/livingroom/light"
  qos: 0
  unit_of_measurement: "/1024"
  ```

## Adding sensors to Lovelace Dashboard

Then to add to a Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
entities:
  - entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
  - entity: sensor.living_room_humidity
  - entity: sensor.living_room_pressure
  - entity: sensor.living_room_light
show_icon: true
show_name: false
show_state: true
title: Living Room
type: glance
```

The result looked well:

However when I clicked in to the graph I could see some wild readings:

![Incorrect temp readings]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/bug.PNG)

## Adding checksum to serial data

The bad readings were due to the unreliability of the serial data. A missing decimal place would cause `22.30` to become `2230`.

I updated the project to send a `crc16` checksum.
The Arduino environment had a utility for this:

```ino
#include <util/crc16.h>

uint16_t calcCRC(char* str)
{
  uint16_t crc=0; // starting value as you like, must be the same before each calculation
  for (int i=0;i<strlen(str);i++) // for each character in the string
  {
    crc= _crc16_update (crc, str[i]); // update the crc value
  }
  return crc;
}
```

I took my readings `serString` and added the `crc16` checksum to the end:

```ino
 int str_len = serString.length() + 1;
 char char_array[str_len];
 serString.toCharArray(char_array, str_len);
 Serial.println(serString + "," + String(calcCRC(char_array)));
```

On the python side I then would verify the checksum before accepting the data. I used the [crcmod](https://pypi.org/project/crcmod/) module for this. This is installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install crcmod
```

Then imported and told to use `crc16`:

```python
import crcmod.predefined
crc16 = crcmod.predefined.mkCrcFun('crc-16')
```

Finally each Arduino checksum is verified against one created in python:

```python
 pyCRC = hex(crc16(rawdata[0:rawdata.rfind(',')].encode('utf-8')))
 data = rawdata.split(',')
 arduinoCRC = hex(int(data[-1]))
 if not pyCRC == arduinoCRC:
    raise Exception("Failed checksum check")
```

I can then see in the process logs bad data being correctly rejected. Here `23.10` for temperature is missing the `2` and becomes `3.10`:

```txt
Error with data
3.10,37,704,1021,-69.04,42153
Failed checksum check
```

The graphed data now looks much better:

![0 temp readings]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/0drop.JPG)

You will see however there is still an issue with bad readings. These are now rare, roughly once a day. The value is also always `0`. My next task is to find the source of these.
