A whitepaper I wrote to has been posted on the KX website [code.kx.com/q/wp/iot-mqtt](https://code.kx.com/q/wp/iot-mqtt/).
It details an example project working through the kdb+ MQTT interface to interact with Home Assistant.

The contents and assets are also available at [github.com/rianoc/MQTT_blog](https://github.com/rianoc/MQTT_blog).
