## Sennheiser CX 300

Solid well prices headphones.

## Sennheiser CX 300 II (2012/10)

After my first pair broke eventually I was happy to get the same again.

## Bose SoundSport (2015/05)

The most comfortable pair of headphones I ever had. I really liked the open sound they had and the secure way they fitted. They did leave background noise in but I did not have a commute on a noisy train so this was not an issue.
Their main flaw was lack of a microphone.

## SoundMAGIC E10C (2017/03)

When the Bose broke I made sure to get a pair with a microphone. I missed the open Bose sound when using these.

## RHA MA650

I bought these without much thought when the SoundMAGIC pair broke. They themselves broke shortly after I bought them. The microphone failed. I replaced them under warranty which was easy at least.

## Bose SoundSport wireless (2019/05)

I bought a refurbished pair of these wanting to try wireless headphones.
They are not perfect. When running they pull themselves out of my ears and the battery life is not great.

I'm holding out to see if Bose release a next-gen pair which charge over USB-C and are reduced in size and weight.

Now that I commute on a noisy train I may also get a cheaper pair of headphones which seal well. I still have the RHS pair but after going wireless it's hard to go back to dealing with the tangle and the wire getting caught on doors and people.

## Anker Soundcore Life P2 (2020/04)

My Bose headphones started to shut off randomly. At the time this pair Anker headphones were available to borrow as they were going spare. For their lower price they are well made and work reliably. For podcasts they work perfectly. Music on the other hand is tinny, lacking bass and generally nowhere near as good as the Bose. They will work as a stop gap until there is a pair on the market which look attractive to me. Currently waiting to see what [Bose Earbuds 500](https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/better_with_bose/new-headphones.html) will be like when they are released.
