## Samsung S10e

I had no problems with my Oneplus 5T but a timing opportunity came up to gift it to someone and move upgrading for myself forward. I had looked at the Oneplus 7 but it was out-of-stock, I found out since the 7T will  be released shortly so the 7 is effectively end-of-life.

I went with a Samsung S10e instead. The white model was at a good price. First impressions have been mostly good. The colour was not to my liking in person, going an odd shade of blue under certain lighting. A case solved the aesthetics and also helped with ergonomics. I had found the side mounted fingerprint-reader hard to pinpoint at times before.

I have an [adapter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B079N4ZT8W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) on order to try Dex which will be interesting. I already have a suitable mouse and keyboard (MX Anwhere 2S and K380 from Logitech)

### Pros

* Headphone jack
* Vibrant screen
* Compact

### Cons

* Battery life is a step down
* No included fast charger (comes with 10W)
* Speaker volume low
