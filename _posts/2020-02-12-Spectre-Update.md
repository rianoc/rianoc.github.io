Following on from my first post on my [Spectre](https://rianoc.github.io/2020/01/18/spectre/) laptop I found an issue.
After reinstalling Windows my keyboard would no longer turn off hen I rotated the machine in to tablet mode.
The rotation sensor was also no working. I went through ensuring I had installed all drivers but had no success.
There was no good leads in online sources either.

I contacted HP support who suggested I should reinstall using the [HP Cloud Recovery Tool](https://support.hp.com/gb-en/document/c06162205).
Running this failed with generic failure "The recovery attempt has failed".  HP then suggested I send the machine in to them, they seemed to prefer this than to inspect the log files from the recovery tool.
I sent the machine to them and got it back very quickly afterwards. Their repair notes listed reinstalling Windows as the only action taken.

So far everything has been working well. No more DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL blue screens.
