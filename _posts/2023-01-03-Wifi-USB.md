## Sinilink WiFi USB switch

I saw a Youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrHhn2AVzSA) showing Sinilink WiFi USB switches being flashed with [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/). I bought a few on Alibaba.

I aim to use them to power some USB devices instead of the current Sonoff S26 smart switches they use currently.

I found some other blogs [(1)](https://tech.scargill.net/aliexpress-sinilink-wifi-usb-controller/) [(2)](https://wiki.tinkernet.ca/index.php/IoT_-_Sinilink_XY-WFUSB) also documenting this process but I still wanted to detail my process, particularly the wiring in more detail.

## Flashing to Tasmota with Tasmotizer

The default software on the sticks has been said to be buggy so going with the open source Tasmota is a better idea. To do this using [Tasmotizer](https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer) makes it easy.

To flash them I did not have a USB FTDI so instead aimed to use a [Raspberry Pi 3 B+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/).

### Setting up the Raspberry Pi

My first attempts to installs failed as my Raspberry Pi had a very old image so I downloaded and installed a new OS using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

As the serial port is needed I opened the `Raspberry Pi Configuration` and under `Interfaces` set `Serial` to `Enabled`. I left `Serial Console` as `Disabled`.

The docs state the only one command would be needed to install:

```bash
sudo python -m pip install tasmotizer
```

This installed but running the app would fail with an error: `No module named 'PyQt5.QtSerialPort'`

To resolve this I ran:

```bash
sudo python -m pip install PyQt5.QtSerialPort
```

### Wiring

I used the information from [blakadder.com](https://templates.blakadder.com/sinilink_XY-WFUSB.html). I worked with the Sinilink button side up with the USB-male pointing to my left the same as the links images.

| Sinilink   | Pi            |
|------------|---------------|
| (1) GND    | (14) GND      |
| (2) TX     | (10) RX       |
| (3) RX     | (8)  TX       |
| (4) GPIO 0 | (39) GND      |
| (5) RST    |               |
| (6) 3.3V   | (1)  3.3V PWR |

I used 5 pieces of wire extracted from a short length of Ethernet cable. The 3.3V wire should be the last one connected.

### Flashing

Launch Tasmotizer using:

```bash
python /usr/local/bin/tasmotizer.py 
```

1. Choose port. For me `ttyS0`
2. Choose `Release`. For me `12.3.1`, I used `tasmota-lite.bin`
3. Click `Tasmotize!`

### Configuring

1. Disconnect the USB switch from the Pi
2. Plug the USB switch in to a powered USB port
3. On your laptop/phone and search for and connect to the WiFi SSID with a name like `tasmota-*` followed by some random numbers.
4. You device should auto redirect to `192.168.4.1`
5. Populate `WiFi Network` and `WiFi Password` and hit `Save`
6. Your device should drop off the `tasmota-*` SSID and reconnect to your WiFi Network and be redirected to the new IP address of the USB Switch
7. In `Configure` >> `Configure Other` populate
    * `Template` with: (+ Check `Activate`)
        ```json
        {"NAME":"XY-WFUSB","GPIO":[1,1,0,1,32,224,0,0,0,0,320,0,544,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":18}
        ```
      * This template is taken from [blakadder.com](https://templates.blakadder.com/sinilink_XY-WFUSB.html)
    * `Device Name` and `Friendly Name 1` to whatever you like
8. Click `Save` and the USB switch will restart
9. In `Configuration` >> `MQTT` populate `Host` and others if needed
10. Click `Save` and the USB switch will restart

### Integrating with Home Assistant

If your flashing/configuration has been done correctly and you already have MQTT set up then the [Tasmota](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tasmota/) integration with automatically discover your new devices.
