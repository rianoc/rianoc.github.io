I have some old Arduino scripts lying around various folders so I've made a start at putting them a on Github.

The first is an [Environmental Monitor](https://github.com/rianoc/EnvironmentalMonitor). It captures things like temperature and humidity. I added a python [script](https://github.com/rianoc/EnvironmentalMonitor/blob/master/serToMQTT.py) to capture the data and publish it to MQTT.

I plan on leaving one Arduino connected permanently to a Raspberry Pi capturing this data.

This data will be captured by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) which I started to look at recently.
