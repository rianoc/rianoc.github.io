Dex has been very impressive and useful. I originally thought I'd need an adapter to use it since Windows USB based version was locked to Note 10 users. Thankfully an update opened this up to other models including the S10e.

### Bugs

* File dragged to phone through Dex cannot be seen Samsung 'My Files' even though other file browsers can see it in the Downloads folder.
* Moving icons on desktop can result in duplicates, and creates accidental folders too easily
* Misses first keystroke in search bar for apps
